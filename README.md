# HVAC-Fault-Detection-System-Project
The goal of this project is to use machine learning methods detect HVAC system faults from sensor data, and show how these insights can benefit InstaHub's occupancy and energy sensors by turning the sensor data into actionable insights.

Note: The combined_FDD (1).xls file is the AHU dataset from South Korea that I am referencing.
